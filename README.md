# Dissertation Appendix 1: Digital Trace Data as Indicators of the Social World: Validating Google Trends for use in Scientific Research

Computational social science and disciplines such as sociology and political science are often quick to adopt new sources 
of digital trace data for use in academic research. In this article, I examine the criterion validity of Google Search Trends
as potential indicators of three different cases, namely attitudes, disease prevalence and political preferences using five
different validated data sources. I use Pearson and Repeated Measures Correlations between the Google Trends and the validated
indicators as well as multiple linear regression (for cross-sectional datasets) and fixed effect hierar- chical linear models
(for longitudinal datasets) as additional tests of the data. I find no correlation among any of the Google Trends tested and 
their validated indicators. While some Google Trends tested were significantly associated with the outcome in the regression 
models, effects tended to be small and the total model interpretability remained low, even when controlling for demographic 
variables. This article shows that there is no criterion validity of Google Trends for these uses and social scientists are 
not able to use Google Trends as a stand-in for high quality survey data.
