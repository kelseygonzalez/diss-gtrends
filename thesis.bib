Both the gender-specific dynamics surrounding what counts as “notability” on the online encyclopedia and Wikipedia's relative categorical incoherence are discussed. If “Big Data” can be said to construct its own object, it is, in this instance, a curious and lop-sided one, exemplifying pitfalls as well as promise with respect to more accurate and democratic forms of knowledge.},

EVM studies consist of presenting participants with carefully constructed and realistic scenarios to assess dependent variables including intentions, attitudes, and behaviors, thereby enhancing experimental realism and also allowing researchers to manipulate and control independent variables. We describe two major types of EVM aimed at assessing explicit (i.e., paper people studies) and implicit (i.e., policy capturing and conjoint analysis) processes and outcomes. We offer best practice recommendations regarding the design and implementation of EVM studies based on a multidisciplinary literature review, discuss substantive domains and topics that can benefit from implementing EVM, address knowledge gaps regarding EVM such as the need to increase realism and the number and diversity of participants, and address ways to overcome some of the negative perceptions about EVM by pointing to exemplary articles that have used EVM successfully. Keywords research design, experimental design, quasi-experimental design Understanding the direction and nature of causal relationships is the cornerstone of science (Shadish, Cook, \& Campbell, 2002). While the majority of management research provides evidence regarding covariation between antecedent and outcome variables, covariation alone does not answer two important questions crucial for establishing causality: (a) Did the antecedent occur temporally}

While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for automated analyses of such “big data,” they lack the theoretical direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First, I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of automated text-classification methods to classify different types of culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of information about the social context in which texts are produced, the construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently necessary to work with big data.},

	abstract     = {A large literature examines the global diffusion of institutions and policies, yet there is much less systematic research on how cultural tastes, consumption preferences, and other individual interests spread across the globe. With a data set that tracks the most popular Google search terms in 199 countries between 2004 and 2014, and drawing on Gabriel de Tarde, this article introduces a theoretical framework to examine how country-level differences shape global imitation of cultural interests and consumer tastes. Contrary to popular accounts, this study finds that cross-national diffusion is surprisingly rare—and seldom U.S. led—but occurs through a multichannel network with many different centers. Negative binomial regression models applied to cases of diffusion in 346,620 country-year dyads reveal that global imitation flows are likely patterned by the power and prestige of countries, their proximities to each other, and the cultural boundaries between them. Accounting for factors such as the influence of large organizations does not disrupt these findings.},

	abstract     = {Recent terrorist attacks by first- and second-generation immigrants in the United States and Europe indicate that radicalization may result from the failure of ethnic integration—or the rise of intergroup prejudice in communities where “home-grown” extremists are raised. Yet, these community-level drivers are notoriously difficult to study because public opinion surveys provide biased measures of both prejudice and radicalization. We examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) Internet searches in 3099 U.S. counties between 2014 and 2016 using instrumental variable models that control for various community-level factors associated with radicalization. We find that anti-Muslim searches are strongly associated with pro-ISIS searches—particularly in communities with high levels of poverty and ethnic homogeneity. Although more research is needed to verify the causal nature of this relationship, this finding suggests that minority groups may be more susceptible to radicalization if they experience discrimination in settings where they are isolated and therefore highly visible—or in communities where they compete with majority groups for limited financial resources. We evaluate the validity of our findings using several other data sources and discuss the implications of our findings for the study of terrorism and intergroup relations, as well as immigration and counterterrorism policies. Internet search data reveal an association between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS searches in U.S. counties.

His death led to U.S.-wide protest that would eventually cross borders, spanning multiple continents. The transnational diffusion of protest and movement frames is a recognized phenomenon in the study of contention. Less well documented are the consequences of such protest for political interest; absent survey data, this is difficult to measure. One alternative is to use Internet search data. This visualization uses Google Trends to document variation in search interest for “racism” across 101 countries and 32 languages during the period before and after George Floyd’s killing. In the majority of countries, there was significantly increased search interest that was sustained for at least two weeks. The findings suggest that transnational protest diffusion may lead to global increases in political interest.},

In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist.We show that an individual's past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.},

Using individual level data, we also find that residents of neighborhoods in which at least one-quarter of the residents are black face a 13 percent increase in the odds of being obese compared to residents of other communities. The association between neighborhood racial composition and obesity is completely attenuated after including statistical controls for the poverty rate and obesity prevalence of respon-dents'neighborhoods. These findings support the underlying assumptions of both institutional and social models of neighborhood effects. 229}

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

I identify four aspects of this problem: the extent to which findings from studies of Facebook and other Big-Data platforms apply to human behavior at the scale of church suppers and department politics where we spend much of our lives; the extent to which the mathematics of scaling might be consistent with behavioral principles, moving beyond a “universal” theory of networks to the study of variation within and between networks; and how a large social field, including its history and culture, shapes the typical representations, interactions, and strategies at local levels in a text or social network.},

I consider a quantitative technique frequently used by Pierre Bourdieu and the mathematics developed by James Coleman for the foundations of his social theory, with respect to each other, from the respective analysts' points of view, and from my concern with developing more sturdy relations among the methodological tools in a practice theorist's kit. Specifically, I treat both frameworks as implementing in innovative ways the concept of 'duality', the co-constitution of elements at one level and relations at another (higher or lower) level of social action. I show that there is a remarkable homology, at the level of their formal practices, between the mathematical techniques of Bourdieu and those of Coleman. New ways to implement Galois lattice analysis are among the gains of this inquiry. Applications are to relations among the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. I identify and discuss several of the larger questions that this study raises about practical methods and methodological practice.}

Using difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people’s mental health may have been severely affected by the pandemic and lockdown.},

Despite the critical role of data in informing this debate, accurate and comprehensive data on firearm sales and ownership is not readily available. In this study, we evaluate the potential of using firearm-related internet search queries as a complementary, freely available, and near-real-time data source for tracking firearm sales and ownership that enables analysis at finer geographic and temporal scales. (Here, we examine data by state and by month to compare with other data sources, but search engine volume can be analyzed by city and by the week or by day). We validate search query volume against available data on background checks in all 50 US states, and find that they are highly correlated over time (Pearson’s r\,=\,0.96, Spearman’s ρ\,=\,0.94) and space (Pearson’s r\,=\,0.78, Spearman’s ρ\,=\,0.76). We find that stratifying this analysis by gun type (long-gun vs. handgun) increases this correlation dramatically, across both time and space. We also find a positive association between firearm-related search query volume and firearm-related mortality (Pearson’s r\,=\,0.87, Spearman’s ρ\,=\,0.90), and a negative association with the strength of state-level firearm control policies (Pearson’s r\,=\,−0.82, Spearman’s ρ\,=\,−0.83). Based on these findings, we propose a framework for prospective surveillance that incorporates firearm-related internet search volume as a useful complementary data source to inform the public health policy debate on this issue.},

	abstract     = {Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems around the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that substantially few patients seek help for suicidality at clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has elicited concerns of an imminent mental health crisis as the course of the pandemic continues to unfold. Clarifying the relationship between the public’s attention to knowledge about suicide and the public’s attention to knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic may provide insight into developing prevention strategies for a putative surge of suicide in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Objective:  The goal of this retrospective, longitudinal time-series study is to understand the relationship between temporal trends of interest for the search term “suicide” and those of COVID-19–related terms, such as “social distancing,” “school closure,” and “lockdown.”  Methods:  We used the Google Trends platform to collect data on daily interest levels for search terms related to suicide, several other mental health-related issues, and COVID-19 over the period between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. A correlational analysis was performed to determine the association between the search term ‘‘suicide’’ and COVID-19–related search terms in 16 countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between interest levels for the search term “suicide” before and after school closure.  Results:  We found that interest levels for the search term “suicide” statistically significantly inversely correlated with interest levels for the search terms “COVID-19” or “coronavirus” in nearly all countries between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. Additionally, search interest for the term ‘‘suicide’’ significantly and negatively correlated with that of many COVID-19–related search terms, and search interest varied between countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between search interest levels for the term “suicide” before and after school closure. The Netherlands ( P =.19), New Zealand ( P =.003), the United Kingdom ( P =.006), and the United States ( P =.049) showed significant negative trends in interest levels for suicide in the 2-week period preceding school closures. In contrast, interest levels for suicide had a significant positive trend in Canada ( P \&lt;.001) and the United States ( P =.002) after school closures.  Conclusions:  The public’s attention to suicide might inversely correlate with the public’s attention to COVID-19–related issues. Additionally, several anticontagion policies, such as school closure, might have led to a turning point for mental health crises, because the attention to suicidality increased after restrictions were implemented. Our results suggest that an increased risk of suicidal ideation may ensue due to the ongoing anticontagion policies. Timely intervention strategies for suicides should therefore be an integral part of efforts to flatten the epidemic curve.  [JMIR Public Health Surveill 2020;6(4):e24694]},

It turns out that, overall, the subjective well-being dropped by 11.7\% for Italy and 8.3\% for Japan in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the last two months of 2019 and even more compared to the historical mean of the indexes. Through a data science approach we try to identify the possible causes of this drop down by considering several explanatory variables including, climate and air quality data, number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, Facebook Covid and flu symptoms global survey, Google Trends data and coronavirus-related searches, Google mobility data, policy intervention measures, economic variables and their Google Trends proxies, as well as health and stress proxy variables based on big data. We show that a simple static regression model is not able to capture the complexity of well-being and therefore we propose a dynamic elastic net approach to show how different group of factors may impact the well-being in different periods, even over a short time length, and showing further country-specific aspects. Finally, a structural equation modeling analysis tries to address the causal relationships among the COVID-19 factors and subjective well-being showing that, overall, prolonged mobility restrictions, flu and Covid-like symptoms, economic uncertainty, social distancing and news about the pandemic have negative effects on the subjective well-being.},

	abstract     = {The strength of weak ties is that they tend to be long—they connect socially distant locations, allowing information to diffuse rapidly. The authors test whether this “strength of weak ties” generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length.Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of manyspatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed ten- dency for social movements to diffuse spatially.}

This article examines the relationships between religion and both body mass index (BMI) and obesity, which have increased in prevalence in the United States over the past two decades. Using longitudinal data from a national sample of adults, this study prospectively examines whether dimensions of religious life are associated with weight gain and the development of obesity during eight years of follow-up. We examine four dimensions of religiosity (attendance, salience, media practice, and consolation) and religious affiliation. Ordinary least squares regression analyses reveal that high levels of religious media practice are associated with higher BMI in women. Logistic regression analyses reveal that high levels of religious media practice and affiliation with a Baptist denomination increased the risk of obesity for women, but that a high level of religious consolation reduced the risk of obesity incidence for men. Attendance at religious services was associated with a lower risk of the incidence of obesity for women, suggesting the importance of studying links between dimensions of religious life and body weight.}

	abstract     = {In the United States, in the last two decennial censuses, 40 per cent of Hispanics rejected racial categories, such as 'White' or 'Black', and racially classified themselves 'Other'. Scholars have argued that the format of the question induced them to respond this way; that those Hispanics who ticked 'Other' are racially intermediate, that is to say, mulatto or mestizo; and, lastly, that Hispanics simply misunderstood the question. This article examines these interpretations. The 1989 sample used consisted of 240 randomly selected Puerto Rican travellers at New York City airports. The methods used were descriptive data analysis and multivariate logit analysis. Three different dimensions of Puerto Rican racial identity are compared: (a) how race is externally defined, namely, by the interviewer; (b) how it is defined by the respondents themselves in both open-ended and closed question formats; and (c) how the respondents think it is defined by (White) North Americans. The determinants of racial self-identity are then explored systematically. Our major conclusion is that racial identity among Puerto Ricans is historically and contextually influenced. Race is more complex than is generally assumed. These findings challenge the hegemonic and static biological view of race that is prevalent in the United States and in classical social science literature. © 1992, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

Healthism represents a particular way of viewing the health problem, and is characteristic of the new health consciousness and movements. It can best be understood as a form of medicalization, meaning that it still retains key medical notions. Like medicine, healthism situates the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual. Solutions are formulated at that level as well. To the extent that healthism shapes popular beliefs, we will continue to have a non-political, and therefore, ultimately ineffective conception and strategy of health promotion. Further, by elevating health to a super value, a metaphor for all that is good in life, healthism reinforces the privatization of the struggle for generalized well-being.}

Whereas performance is best when combining clinical and web data, using solely web data yields comparative performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict vaccination uptake using web data (with and without clinical data).},

I address these gaps by examining black-white differences in the associations between an important anticipatory stressor—goal-striving stress (GSS)—and several measures of psychophysiology. Hypotheses focusing on racial differences in GSS and psychophysiology are tested using self-report and biomarker data from the Nashville Stress and Health Study (2011–2014), a cross-sectional probability survey of black and white working-age adults from Davidson County, Tennessee (n = 1,252). Compared to their white peers, blacks with higher GSS report greater self-esteem and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, increased GSS also predicts elevated levels of high-effort coping (i.e., John Henryism), neuroendocrine stress hormones, and blood pressure for blacks but not whites. I discuss the implications of these findings for scholars interested in the stress process and broader black-white health inequalities in the United States.}

We contrast what health content people seek via search engines vs. share on social media, as well as why they choose a particular platform for online health activities. We reflect on the implications of our results for designing search engines, social media, and social search tools that better support people’s health information seeking and sharing needs.},

This need to belong is rooted in evolutionary history and gave rise to the development of traits that enable individuals to gain acceptance and to avoid rejection. Because belongingness is a core component of human functioning, social exclusion should influence many cognitive, emotional, and behavioral outcomes and personality expression. This article summarizes recent evidence that social exclusion causes an assortment of outcomes, many of which depend on whether the excluded can gain acceptance or forestall possible distress. It highlights common overlap in physical and social pain systems and how a physical painkiller can reduce the pain of social exclusion. Finally, it shows how social exclusion moderates the effects of traits on cognition, emotion, and behavior. To appreciate personality processes in social contexts, scientists should consider how people respond to social exclusion and how the need to belong influences personality expression. © 2011, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

Ten to twenty years ago, John Chambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested the catchy name "Data Science" for his envisioned field.}

Understanding generative mechanisms - be they system, mechanism, or algorithmic - seems the most promising way to proceed. The role of statistical causality is a source of potential data analytic tools that can be mobilized within analyses conducted in the spirit of the other three types of causality.}

	abstract     = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has powerfully shaped people’s lives. The current work investigated the emotional and behavioral reactions people experience in response to COVID-19 through their internet searches. We hypothesised that when the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increase, people would experience more fear, which in turn would predict more searches for protective behaviors, health-related knowledge, and panic buying. Methods Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were measured using internet search volumes in Google Trends. Results We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Fear-related emotions explained the associations between COVID-19 and the content of their internet searches. Conclusions Findings suggest that exposure to COVID-19 prevalence and fear-related emotions may motivate people to search for relevant health-related information so as to protect themselves from the pandemic.},

Over the life cycle, however, aspirations grow along with income, and undercut the favourable effect of income growth on happiness, although the cross-sectional happiness-income difference persists. People think they were less happy in the past and will be happier in the future, because they project current aspirations to be the same throughout the life cycle, while income grows. But since aspirations actually grow along with income, experienced happiness is systematically different from projected happiness. Consequently, choices turn out to be based on false expectations. © Royal Economic Society 2001. Published by Blackwell Publishers.}

In addition to assessing bonding and bridging social capital, we explore a dimension of social capital that assesses one's ability to stay connected with members of a previously inhabited community, which we call maintained social capital. Regression analyses conducted on results from a survey of undergraduate students (N = 286) suggest a strong association between use of Facebook and the three types of social capital, with the strongest relationship being to bridging social capital. In addition, Facebook usage was found to interact with measures of psychological well-being, suggesting that it might provide greater benefits for users experiencing low self-esteem and low life satisfaction. © 2007 International Communication Association.}

	abstract     = {Drawing from cumulative disadvantage theory, the health consequences of obesity are considered in light of the accumulation of risk factors over the life course. Two forms of compensation are also examined to determine if the risk due to obesity is persistent or modifiable. Analyses make use of data from a national survey to examine the consequences of obesity on disability among respondents 45 years of age or older, tracked across 20 years (N = 4,106). Results from tobit models indicate that obesity, especially when experienced early in life, is consistently related to lower-body disability. The results also show that obesity has long-term health consequences during adulthood, altering the life course in an enduring way. Compensation was not manifest from risk-factor elimination (weight loss), but rather through regular exercise. Although there is evidence for long-term consequences of risk factors on health, the findings suggest that more attention should be given to compensatory mechanisms in the development of cumulative disadvantage theory. Sociological studies of life chances and well-being have contributed much to our understanding of the life course and the structure of inequality. As empirical generalizations accumulate on how inequality develops over the life course, recent research points to two innovations that have greatly shaped the course of inquiry. First, examining physical or biological markers-whether measured or reported-reveal much about life course opportunities and constraints (Barker 1997; Booth, Carver, and Granger 2000; Conley and Bennett 2000; Seeman et al. 2001). Many markers of physical characteristics, such as birth weight, hormones, and skin tones, may be associated with social arrangements and, hence, quality of life. Indeed, there are many ways that these or other physical characteristics may shape opportunities in life, including perceived attractiveness, stigma, and stratification. Second, long-term examinations of life chances, health, and well-being demonstrate the importance of taking the "long view" in studying life course inequality-integrating information over decades of the life course (Blackwell, Hay ward, and Crimmins 2001; Ferraro and Farmer 1999; Sampson and Laub 1996; Warren, Hauser, and Sheridan 2002). Some risks are immediate in their effects, but others take considerable time to become manifest. One risk that has garnered considerable attention during the past decade is excess body weight. Obesity has long been recognized as a target of stigma in many societies (DeJong 1980; Stunkard, LaFleur, and Wadden 1998) and has influenced labor market location}

Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close.© 2009 by the University of Chicago. All Rights Reserved.}

	abstract     = {'Second-generation decline’ questions the current American faith in the myth of nearly automatic immigrant success. In discussing economic scenarios, positive and negative, for the future of the children of the post-1965 immigrants, the possibility is proposed that a significant number of the children of poor immigrants, especially dark-skinned ones, might not obtain jobs in the mainstream economy. Neither will they be willing - or even able - to take low-wage, long-hour ‘immigrant’ jobs, as their parents did. As a result, they (and young males among them particularly) may join blacks and Hispanics among those already excluded, apparently permanently, from the mainstream economy. The article also deals with the relations between ethnicity and economic conditions in the USA and with the continued relevance of the assimilation and acculturation processes described by 'straight-line theory’. This issue, as well as most others discussed, may also be salient for European countries experiencing immigration, especially those countries with troubled economies. © 1992, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

Method: The article begins with a discussion of clinical outcome studies. It then reports on a phenomenological study of 32 former sufferers contacted through a newspaper article which included the author's own recovery story. Participants' narratives were analyzed to elucidate the social sources of recovery. Results: The analysis refers to the coherence and mythological structure of the narratives and to their rituals of recovery and its 'spiritual' nature, as understood by participants. Discussion: Anorexia and recovery are conceptualized as two phases in an ascetic rite of passage which involves a confrontation with death and an eventual return to fuller community life. Suggestions are offered concerning the ways this insight can be translated into clinical practice.}

	abstract     = {The social construction of overweight has meant that dieting is an experience of being a woman in Western society. Health promotion fails to counteract the cult of slimness and reinforces medicalized notions of the ''problem'' of overweight, legitimizing unnecessary dieting practices. The limitations of the health promotion approach are examined through medicalization and healthism critiques. The negative consequences for women of dieting to control weight are highlighted in this article through the concepts of gendered food and gendered bodies. The issue of gender and dieting is used here to illustrate the need for interdisciplinary and qualitative approaches to the study of food and nutrition practices, before intervening to change those practices. An examination of the social implications of health promotion in the area of weight control exposes the need for a moratorium on such strategies until a database of qualitative research is established through sociological studies on food and nutrition. I Scientific studies have revealed the now well known links between diet and health in Western societies, where attempts have been made to reverse undesirable dietary trends in targeted groups or the whole population using health promotion techniques. Such attempts have met with limited success and often send conflicting messages to the community; this is particularly the case with women who diet. This article combines Australian and international literature in a thesis which argues that the relative failure of health promotion in the area of weight control can be explained by deconstructing the underlying assumptions such campaigns are based upon. Existing empirical studies clearly show that a majority of women diet, many of whom do so unnecessarily since they would not be medically defined as 0195-6663/96/050097+12 \$25.00/0}

Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we examined allostatic load scores for adults aged 18-64 years. We estimated probability of a high score by age, race, gender, and poverty status and Blacks' odds of having a high score relative to Whites' odds. Results. Blacks had higher scores than did Whites and had a greater probability of a high score at all ages, particularly at 35-64 years. Racial differences were not explained by poverty. Poor and nonpoor Black women had the highest and second highest probability of high allostatic load scores, respectively, and the highest excess scores compared with their male or White counterparts. Conclusions. We found evidence that racial inequalities in health exist across a range of biological systems among adults and are not explained by racial differences in poverty. The weathering effects of living in a race-conscious society may be greatest among those Blacks most likely to engage in high-effort coping.}

This study extends previous research by estimating the influence of body mass on occupational attainment over three decades of the career using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. In a series of covariance structure analyses, we considered three mechanisms that may alter the career trajectories of heavy individuals: (1. employment-based discrimination , (2. educational attainment, and (3. marriage market processes. Unlike previous studies, we found limited evidence that employment-based discrimination impaired the career trajectories of either men or women. Instead, we found that heavy women received less post-secondary schooling than their thinner peers, which in turn adversely affected their occupational standing at each point in their careers.}

The concept of possible selves, however, generally has not been extended to examining the aftermath of personal transformation. In this article I explore the self and social processes that operate during efforts to validate possible selves after self-change is complete. Using data gathered during in-depth qualitative interviews with 46 respondents who sustained weight loss over time, I analyze the role of possible selves in efforts to maintain intentional self-change. Findings show that many possible selves associated with weight loss are not fulfilled, and that the gap between potential and actual selves must be negotiated before persons can consider their weight loss both "successful" and "complete." This gap is bridged by drawing on structural and cultural resources found within processes of self-verification and identity control and in the revision of personal narrative. By combining these resources, persons recognized and negotiated the gap between their expectations and the reality of intentional self-change.}

	abstract     = {Increasingly, social scientists are turning to childhood to gain a better understanding of the fundamental social causes of adult mortality. However, evidence of the link between childhood and the mortality of adults is fragmentary, and the intervening mechanisms remain unclear. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, our analysis shows that men's mortality is associated with an array of childhood conditions, including socioeconomic status, family living arrangements, mother's work status, rural residence, and parents' nativity. With the exception of parental nativity, socioeconomic-achievement processes in adulthood and lifestyle factors mediated these associations. Education, family income, household wealth, and occupation mediated the influence of socioeconomic status in childhood. Adult lifestyle factors, particularly body mass, mediated the effects of family living arrangements in childhood, mother's work status, and rural residence. Our findings bring into sharp focus the idea that economic and educational policies that are targeted at children's well-being are implicitly health policies with effects that reach far into the adult life course.}

	abstract     = {Objectives: We test whether the association between state religiosity and distance travelled is moderated by population age during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Mobility is operationalized as the state-level average median distance traveled from February 24 to May 4 across the contiguous United States. Shelter-in-place rates are operationalized as the state-level percentage of users staying home. State religiosity is measured with an index of aggregated religious identities, beliefs, and practices. Population age is indicated by the state percentage of adults aged 65 and older. We model population mobility using regression with state clustered robust standard errors. Results: We observe that religious states tend to travel more during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the behavioral risks associated with state religiosity are less pronounced in states with larger elderly populations. Discussion: We contribute to our understanding of the social patterning of pandemic mobility in aging populations.}

	abstract     = {The increasing prevalence of obesity in the adult population has important implications for the health status of the population. Understanding the reasons for this increase will provide guidance in developing public health approaches to address the problem. In this paper we examine the changing relationship between educational attainment and obesity. We use annual cross-sectional survey data (National Health Interview Survey) of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years or older conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control. Our results show that the educational advantage in obesity is declining. The prevalence of obesity among those with more than a high school education has increased at a faster rate than it has among those with less than a high school education between 1984 and 1994 (76 percent versus 41 percent among whites and 77 percent versus 27 percent among blacks). If the prevalence of obesity by educational level had stayed the same, the increased educational attainment of the population would have led to a decline in overall obesity prevalence. If the educational differentials in obesity had not changed, obesity would have been expected to increase from 11.77 percent to 15.62 percent of the population between 1984 and 1994, compared to the 18.21 percent observed. In contrast to expectations, the increased educational level of the adult population has not resulted in a decline in obesity. Although future cohorts of older adults are likely to be better educated, they also are more likely to be obese, leading to increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.}

Using the nonparametric~directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal~identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past treatments do~not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not~affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new~nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed~effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to~draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between~matching and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables~a diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for~unobservables in the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment~and outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its application~to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade volume.}

We study the spatial variations in aggregate Google Search and Twitter trends across 208 Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in the United States and their association with regional health. We find that information-seeking behavior from Google Trends data is better able to predict the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and impending behavioral risks, with an average gain of 19\% over sociodemographics and regional controls, and of 15\% over information-sharing behavior on Twitter. Both kinds of digital traces track cultural and socioeconomic contexts; however, information-seeking behavior provides insights into personal habits, while information-sharing provides psychological insights. Our findings can be applied to design online and offline human-centered health interventions that target at-risk populations through a knowledge of their lifestyle and concerns.},

	abstract     = {Background: COVID 19 is the first pandemic that has led to a global health crisis. This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate this global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future. Objective: In this study, a statistical approach has been proposed that forecasts the incidence of the COVID 19 epidemic in Spain by means of correlation test and using information from search data provided by Google Trends. Methods: Our method consists of the linear correlation between the Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain -dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III- of cases of COVID 19 reported with a certain time lag, enabling the identification of anticipatory patterns. Results: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that using this correlation test the evolution of the COVID 19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain, up to 11 days in advance. Conclusions: During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. This can be of great help given the critical (if not dramatic) need for complementary monitoring approaches, which can work on a population level, and inform public health decisions in real time.},

"Skewed" groups contain a large preponderance of one type (the numerical "dominants") over another (the rare "tokens"). A framework is developed for conceptualizing the processes that occur between dominants and tokens. Three perceptual phenomena are associated with tokens: visibility (tokens capture a disproportionate awareness share), polarization (differences between tokens and dominants are exaggerated), and assimilation (tokens' attributes are distorted to fit preexisting generalizations about their social type). Visibility generates performance pressures; polarization leads dominants to heighten their group boundaries; and assimilation leads to the tokens' role entrapment. Illustrations are drawn from a field study in a large industrial corporation. Concepts are extended to tokens of all kinds, and research issues are identified.}

	abstract     = {How does network structure influence opinion? Relying on theories of preference formation and social networks, we randomize a sample of adults into networks that vary in structure. In one (a clustered lattice), individuals' connections tend to be connected to each other; in another (a random network), individuals' connections tend not to be connected, instead providing access to different regions of the network. We seed messages that reflect competing sides of policy debates in each network: one underdog viewpoint is seeded less often, while a dominant viewpoint is seeded more often. We track their diffusion and find that the random network increases exposure to underdog views, compared with the clustered lattice. Individuals in the random network subsequently learn more about the policy debates and become more sympathetic toward the underdog perspective. This has implications for how less funded information campaigns can strategically target social networks to maximize exposure and change minds.}

At the core of some social issues are framing competitions, struggles over the production of ideas and meanings. This article examines competing cultural meanings about the fat body. Through frame analysis of organizational materials, I map the contested field of obesity and document three cultural frames - medical frame, social justice frame, and market choice frame - as represented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA), and the food industry group the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), respectively. Using the "framing matrix," I explore each frame's key signature elements and discuss its social and cultural significance. Notably, each frame leads to different outcomes for social equality and how society thinks about fat bodies, health, and public policy. © 2008 Alpha Kappa Delta.}

The study concludes that under certain circumstances, stigma may be used to change behavior from deviant to normal and that a deviant identity, deviant behavior and a deviant way of life do not always vary together}

	abstract     = {The theory behind public economics needs radical reform. It fails to explain the recent history of human welfare and it ignores some of the key findings of modern psychology. Indeed these two failings are intimately linked: it is because the theory ignores psychology that it is unable to explain the facts. The fact is that, despite massive increases in purchasing power, people in the West are no happier than they were fifty years ago. We know this from population surveys and other supporting evidence which I shall review. The most obvious explanations come from three standard findings of the new psychology of happiness. 1 First, a person's happiness is negatively affected by the incomes of others (a negative externality). Second, a person's happiness adapts quite rapidly to higher levels of income (a phenomenon of addiction). And third, our tastes are not given-the happiness we get from what we have is largely culturally determined. These findings provide a challenge to the theory and conclusions of public economics, as set out for example in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980). The challenge to public economics is to incorporate the findings of modern psychology while retaining the rigour of the cost-benefit framework which is the strength and glory of our subject. 2 In what follows I shall first review the measurement of happiness. Then I shall take the three findings that I discussed one by one, and pursue the policy implications of each of them. I shall end with some overall reflections.}

	abstract     = {Asian Americans as a group consist of over 20 national origin groups with distinctive ethnicity, language, religion, cultural practices, immigration history, and perceptions of life in the United States. While “Asian American” has been interchangeably used to refer to both racial and pan-ethnic grouping of individuals of Asian heritage, the exact meaning of the term varies contextually by one's ethnicity, experiences, and other social, structural, and cultural characteristics. In this article, I investigate three distinctive ways in which Asian Americans understand and enact upon their pan-ethnicity: (a) as a political instrument, (b) as a social group identity, and (c) as a path of integration into the mainstream society. Then, I briefly discuss implications of pan-ethnicity for Asian Americans, before turning to the discussion of ways in which future research could further investigate the complexities of pan-ethnicity. I conclude by attempting to provide a nuanced definition of Asian American pan-ethnicity based on the literature reviewed in this article.}

To inform successful vaccination campaigns, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in the UK and the USA to quantify how exposure to online misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines affects intent to vaccinate to protect oneself or others. Here we show that in both countries—as of September 2020—fewer people would ‘definitely’ take a vaccine than is likely required for herd immunity, and that, relative to factual information, recent misinformation induced a decline in intent of 6.2 percentage points (95th percentile interval 3.9 to 8.5) in the UK and 6.4 percentage points (95th percentile interval 4.0 to 8.8) in the USA among those who stated that they would definitely accept a vaccine. We also find that some sociodemographic groups are differentially impacted by exposure to misinformation. Finally, we show that scientific-sounding misinformation is more strongly associated with declines in vaccination intent.},

	abstract     = {Addressing the question of why some people are happier than others is important for both theoretical and practical reasons and should be a central goal of a comprehensive positive psychology. Following a construal theory of happiness, the author proposes that multiple cognitive and motivational processes moderate the impact of the objective environment on well-being. Thus, to understand why some people are happier than others, one must understand the cognitive and motivational processes that serve to maintain, and even enhance, enduring happiness and transient mood. The author's approach has been to explore hedonically relevant psychological processes, such as social comparison, dissonance reduction, self-reflection, self-evaluation, and person perception, in chronically happy and unhappy individuals. In support of a construal framework, self-rated happy and unhappy people have been shown to differ systematically in the particular cognitive and motivational strategies they use. Promising research directions for positive psychology in pursuit of the sources of happiness, as well as the implications of the construal approach for prescriptions for enhancing well-being, are discussed.}

Data came from National Survey of Families and Households 1987-1993 respondents ages 19 to 65 (N = 6,948). Differences between men and women as well as between young and midlife adults were investigated. Multivariate analyses revealed a complex pattern of effects depending on the contrast and the outcome examined. Although marriage continued to promote well-being for both men and women, in some cases - for example, autonomy, personal growth - the single fared better than the married. The effects of continuity in single status were not very different for women in contrast to men. The transition to divorce or widowhood was associated with somewhat more negative effects for women. Midlife adults evidenced more psychological resilience than young adults did in facing the challenges of a marital transition or remaining single over time.}

One aspect of social justice involves the differential treatment of demographic groups in the criminal justice system. While data consistently show that Blacks and Hispanics are often treated differently than Whites, one understudied aspect of these disparities is how police officers' assessments of suspects' size affects their decisions. Using over 3 million cases from the New York Police Department (NYPD) Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) Database, 2006-2013, this study is the first to explore suspects' race, perceived size, and police treatment. Results indicate that tall and heavy black and Hispanic men are at the greatest risk for frisk or search. Tall and heavy suspects are at increased risk for experiencing police force, with black and Hispanic men being more likely to experience force than white men across size categories.}

The promises of social data are many, including understanding ``what the world thinks'' about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naive usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them.},

To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted a field experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latino job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent résumés and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer. In fact, black and Latino applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants' experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.}

	abstract     = {Keywords: Consumer health information Anxiety disorders Depression Stress disorders Post-traumatic Unsupervised machine learning Consumer health information a b s t r a c t Objectives: Social media, including online health communities, have become popular platforms for individuals to discuss health challenges and exchange social support with others. These platforms can provide support for individuals who are concerned about social stigma and discrimination associated with their illness. Although mental health conditions can share similar symptoms and even co-occur, the extent to which discussion topics in online mental health communities are similar, different, or overlapping is unknown. Discovering the topical similarities and differences could potentially inform the design of related mental health communities and patient education programs. This study employs text mining, qualitative analysis, and visualization techniques to compare discussion topics in publicly accessible online mental health communities for three conditions: Anxiety, Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Methods: First, online discussion content for the three conditions was collected from three Reddit communities (r/Anxiety, r/Depression, and r/PTSD). Second, content was pre-processed, and then clustered using the k-means algorithm to identify themes that were commonly discussed by members. Third, we qualitatively examined the common themes to better understand them as well as their similarities and differences. Fourth, we employed multiple visualization techniques to form a deeper understanding of the relationships among the identified themes for the three mental health conditions. Results: The three mental health communities shared four themes: sharing of positive emotion, gratitude for receiving emotional support, and sleep-and work-related issues. Depression clusters tended to focus on self-expressed contextual aspects of depression, whereas the Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder clusters addressed more treatment-and medication-related issues. Visualizations showed that discussion topics from the Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder subreddits shared more similarities to one another than to the depression subreddit. Conclusions: We observed that the members of the three communities shared several overlapping concerns (i.e., sleep-and work-related problems) and discussion patterns (i.e., sharing of positive emotion and showing gratitude for receiving emotional support). We also highlighted that the discussions from the r/Anxiety and r/PTSD communities were more similar to one another than to discussions from the r/Depression community. The r/Anxiety and r/PTSD subreddit members are more likely to be individuals whose experiences with a condition are long-term, and who are interested in treatments and medications. The r/Depression subreddit members may be a comparatively diffuse group, many of whom are dealing with transient issues that cause depressed mood. The findings from this study could be used to inform the design of online mental health communities and patient education programs for these conditions. Moreover, we suggest that researchers employ multiple methods to fully understand the subtle differences when comparing similar discussions from online health communities.}

While scholars in the medical arena often focus on proximate factors contributing to ill-health, distal factors can be critical sources of public health problems such as obesity. This paper will highlight important distal factors found to be associated with obesity. Empirical studies reveal the allocation of resources and goods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, low fat-high protein foods, exercise opportunity, and education on nutrition, health, and diet are not equally distributed. Moreover, cultural attitudes toward thinness, health, and beauty are not universal but subject to cultural and ethnic interpretation. The unequal and often distinctly different distribution of goods, services, and knowledge has been directly linked to obesity disparity rates by race, social class, and gender. Policy recommendations and suggestions for future research conclude the paper.}

Liberal attitudes result from cognitive and personality development, from direct socialization, or from "ideological refinement.' The authors argue that the mechanism by which education influences attitudes can be clarified by considering economic attitudes as well as social attitudes. The authors focus on attitudes toward homeless people. Using a US nationwide survey, it is found that education is associated with greater tolerance for homeless people but less support for economic aid to the homeless. These data support the socialization model, and we conclude that education socializes students to the "official culture,' which in the US includes values of equal opportunity and equal respect - but not equal outcomes. -from Authors}

In this paper we survey published research on ethnic group density and health with the aim of stimulating further research. We situate the research question in the context of contemporary social epidemiology and provide a narrative review of studies of ethnic density and health. We go on to discuss processes which may underlie ethnic density effects, and highlight gaps in the literature and opportunities for further research. Although first recognised in studies of mental illness, 'group density' effects on physical health have been shown more recently. Generally, given individual material circumstances, living in a poorer area is associated with worse health. Members of ethnic minorities who live in areas where there are few like themselves are likely to be materially better off, and living in better neighbourhoods, than those who live in areas with a higher concentration. However, through the eyes of the majority community, they may be made more aware of belonging to a low status minority group, and the psychosocial effects of stigma may offset any advantage. If the psychological effects of stigma are sometimes powerful enough to override material advantage, this may have implications for our understanding of how low social status affects health more generally. As well as highlighting the importance of low social status, cultural isolation and social support to health and quality of life, this paper shows how an understanding of group density effects also has something to offer to our understanding of issues of prejudice, segregation, assimilation and integration in diverse societies. © 2008 Taylor \& Francis.}

It is shown that both overweight men and women are susceptible to weight discrimination in the workplace. Severely obese individuals report more relationship strain and less support from family members compared to thinner peers, and other research illustrates a positive link between body mass index and loneli­ ness, even after controlling for age, gender, annual income, employment, and marital sta­ tus. Obese children and adults are vulnerable targets of stigma and discrimination because of their excess weight. Weight-based stigmatization, or "weight bias," occurs in many do­ mains of daily living and poses significant and debilitating consequences for emotional well-being, social functioning, and physical health (Brownell et al. 2005). Weight-based stereotypes remain socially acceptable in North American culture, including widespread perceptions that obese persons are lazy, lacking in self-discipline, lacking in willpower, impulsive, incompetent, unmotivated, non-compliant, and sloppy (Puhl and Brownell 2001; Puhl and Heuer 2009, Roehling et al. 2008). These negative public attributions of­ ten lead to inequities in employment settings, disparities in health care, disadvantages in educational institutions, and damaged interpersonal relationships (Puhl and Heuer 2009). Recent estimates suggest that the prevalence of weight discrimination in the United States has increased by 66 percent over the past decade and is similar to rates of racial}

	abstract     = {The United States shows striking racial and ethnic differences in marriage patterns. Compared to both white and Hispanic women, black women marry later in life, are less likely to marry at all, and have higher rates of marital instability. Kelly Raley, Megan Sweeney, and Danielle Wondra begin by reviewing common explanations for these differences, which first gained momentum in the 1960s (though patterns of marital instability diverged earlier than patterns of marriage formation). Structural factors—for example, declining employment prospects and rising incarceration rates for unskilled black men—clearly play a role, the authors write, but such factors don’t fully explain the divergence in marriage patterns. In particular, they don’t tell us why we see racial and ethnic differences in marriage across all levels of education, and not just among the unskilled. Raley, Sweeney and, Wondra argue that the racial gap in marriage that emerged in the 1960s, and has grown since, is due partly to broad changes in ideas about family arrangements that have made marriage optional. As the imperative to marry has fallen, alongside other changes in the economy that have increased women’s economic contributions to the household, socioeconomic standing has become increasingly important for marriage. Race continues to be associated with economic disadvantage, and thus as economic factors have become more relevant to marriage and marital stability, the racial gap in marriage has grown.}

The pattern is different for certain subgroups of the population. Those in the bottom quartile in family income showed little decline in happiness during the initial period and a steeper rise during the 1970s. A similar pattern was observed for those age 65 and older. Further analysis of the differences among age groups suggests that cohort effects dominate true age effects, and that the period effect observed prior to the 1970s was greater among young people than among older people. These patterns are interpreted as evidence of a possible shift away from materialistic values during the 1960s. The magnitude of the trend, however, is very small. © 1982 The University of North Carolina Press.}

Are bureaucratic rules most consequential by providing predictability, as suggested by Weber, or problematic, owing to assaults on autonomy? And what of proximate social relations, seen as fundamental in ethnographic, resistance, and justice accounts? This article's analyses, which draw on a unique sample of approximately 2,500 German workers across heterogeneous contexts, reveal pronounced effects of horizontal and vertical social relations on worker (i.e., satisfaction and fairness) and workplace (i.e., commitment and effort) outcomes. These effects, which hold for high- and low-status workers, exist beyond independent, mediating, or conditional associations with rules and have differing implications for women versus men. The authors discuss the importance of their findings for work, organizational, and inequality literatures and call for greater attention to relational dimensions of work-life, their frequent disconnect from bureaucratic structures, and the consequences for organizations and the individuals within.}

College students (n = 104) rated applicants for two different positions. The applicants' résumés either were accompanied by pictures of obese and nonobese targets who were matched in attractiveness or by written descriptions of obses and nonobese targets whose attractiveness was not described. A pretest confirmed that students who read these descriptions perceived nonobese targets as significantly more attractive than obese targets. Results showed that when attractiveness was controlled (i.e., the students saw pictures), students exhibited little negative stereotyping of obese applicants. In contrast, students who had to infer the target's attractiveness from a written description rated obsese applicants more negatively than nonobese applicants. These results, which occurred on one of the two résumés used, suggest that obese individuals sometimes are evaluated negatively, and that this is due to the physical unattractiveness associated with increased weight.

	abstract     = {Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused the worst international crisis since World War II. Italy was one of the countries most affected by both the pandemic and the related infodemic. The success of anti-COVID-19 strategies and future public health policies in Italy cannot prescind from containment of fake news and divulgation of correct information.Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on conspiracy attitudes and risk perception of Italian web users.Methods: Google Trends was used to monitor users' web interest in specific topics, such as conspiracy hypotheses, vaccine side effects, and pollution/climate change. The keywords adopted to represent these topics were mined from Bufale.net – an Italian website specialized in detecting online hoaxes – and Google Trends suggestions (i.e., related topics and related queries). Relative search volumes of the timelapse 2016-2020 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020-2021 (post-COVID-19) were compared through percentage difference (∆\_\%) and Welch’s t-test (t). When data series were not stationary, other ad-hoc criteria were used. The trend slopes were assessed through Sen's Slope (SS). The significance thresholds have been indicatively set at P=.05 and t=1.9.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically enforced Italian netizens' conspiracy attitudes (Δ\_\%∈[60,288],t∈[6,12]). The regional web interest towards conspiracy-related queries has increased and become more homogeneous compared to the pre-COVID-19 period ((RSV) ̅=80±2.8,t\_min=1.8,Δ\_(min\%)=+12.4,min ∆\_(SD\%)=-25.8). Besides, a growing trend in web interest in the infodemic YouTube channel "ByoBlu" has been highlighted. The web interest in fake news has increased more than that in anti-hoax services (t\_1=11.3 vs t\_2=4.5,Δ\_1=+157.6 vs Δ\_2=+84.7). Equivalently, the web interest in vaccine side effects exceeded that in pollution/climate change (SS\_vac=0.22,P{$<$}.001 vs SS\_pol=0.05,P{$<$}.001,∆\_\%=+296.4).Conclusions: COVID-19 has given a significant boost to online conspiracy attitudes in Italy. In particular, the average web interest in conspiracy hypotheses has increased and become more uniform across regions. The pandemic accelerated an already growing trend in users' interest towards some fake news sources, including the 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel "ByoBlu" (canceled for disinformation in March 2021). The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so distorted that vaccine side effects-related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate change, which are much more urgent issues. Based on these findings, it is necessary that the Italian authorities implement more effective infoveillance systems and communication by the mass media is less sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google Trends can be used to monitor the users' response to specific infodemiological countermeasures. Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perceptionKeywords: COVID-19, fake news, Google Trends, infodemiology, Italy, risk perception}

	abstract     = {and Keywords This chapter reviews medical assumptions that higher body mass is necessarily and in and of itself unhealthy, and also evaluates the social processes which contribute to scien­ tific and popular understandings of obesity as a medical problem and public health crisis. The social implications of reinforcing and legitimizing such assumptions are then ex­ plained. There is evidence that the obesity epidemic resonates on a symbolic level for many Americans. The extent to which obesity and/or being overweight represents a pub­ lic health crisis is a topic of heated medical debate. While most social scientists choose to ignore, minimize, or bracket these debates, others are examining the evidence on both sides, searching for social, political, and economic factors contributing to the emergence of obesity as a major social problem, and studying the social effects of framing higher body weight as a medical pathology. Keywords: body weight, body mass, obesity, medical problem, public health, social problem (p. 572) Most of social research on obesity takes for granted the idea that having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 (the official cutoff for "obesity") or even 25 (the cur­ rent cutoff for "overweight") is by definition medically pathological. If one additionally considers that over 65 percent of Americans aged 25-59 had a BMI greater than 25 in 1999-2002 (Flegal et al. 2005), it is easy to see why many people are alarmed. Consistent with this framing, social scientific research typically seeks the causes of "obesity" and/or "overweight," or searches for ways to prevent or reduce these alleged medical problems. Reflecting these patterns, chapters in this volume search for the causes of "obesity" or fo­ cus on prevention and treatment and policy making designed to reduce the incidence of "obesity" and/or "overweight." Here, in this section of the Handbook on "The Conse­ quences of Obesity," is the place to consider, or reconsider, the medical and social conse­ quences of higher body mass. We have been asked to specifically address skepticism-as expressed by both medical researchers and social scientists-about the underlying med­ ical risks of obesity and overweight.}

	abstract     = {Despite recent and growing media attention surrounding obesity in the United States, the so-called obesity epidemic remains a highly contested scientific and social fact. This article examines the contemporary obesity debate through systematic examination of the claims and claimants involved in the controversy. We argue that four primary groups-antiobesity researchers, antiobesity activists, fat acceptance researchers, and fat acceptance activists-are at the forefront of this controversy and that these groups are fundamentally engaged in framing contests over the nature and consequences of excess body weight. While members of the fat acceptance groups embrace a body diversity frame, presenting fatness as a natural and largely inevitable form of diversity, members of the antiobesity camp frame higher weights as risky behavior akin to smoking, implying that body weight is under personal control and that people have a moral and medical responsibility to manage their weight. Both groups sometimes frame obesity as an illness, which limits blame by suggesting that weight is biologically or genetically determined but simultaneously stigmatizes fat bodies as diseased. While the antiobesity camp frames obesity as an epidemic to increase public attention, fat acceptance activists argue that concern over obesity is distracting attention from a host of more important health issues for fat Americans. We examine the strategies claimants use to establish their own credibility or discredit their opponents, and explain how the fat acceptance movement has exploited structural opportunities and cultural resources created by AIDS activism and feminism to wield some influence over U.S. public health approaches. We conclude that notions of morality play a central role in the controversy over obesity, as in many medical disputes, and illustrate how medical arguments about body weight can be used to stymie rights claims and justify morality-based fears.

In this paper, we further develop a sampling and estimation technique called respondent-driven sampling, which allows researchers to make asymptotically unbiased estimates about these hidden populations. The sample is selected with a snowball-type design that can be done more cheaply, quickly, and easily than other methods currently in use. Further, we can show that under certain specified (and quite general) conditions, our estimates for the percentage of the population with a specific trait are asymptotically unbiased. We further show that these estimates are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected. We conclude with a comparison of respondent-driven samples of jazz musicians in New York and San Francisco, with corresponding institutional samples of jazz musicians from these cities. The results show that some standard methods for studying hidden populations can produce misleading results. © 2004, American Sociological Association. All rights reserved.}

	abstract     = {Obesity and poor long-term results of obesity treatment remain an interesting paradox in modern societies. Medical and social pressures to lose weight seem to be substantial, treatment is theoretically easy and many studies suggest that quality of life is improved among reduced-obese. Nevertheless, only few obese people lose weight permanently. The aim of my study was to explore the influence of obesity and weight loss on obese people's well-being and quality of life, to study success and failure to control weight and examine conditions associated with sustained weight loss. The study consisted of five sub-studies ranging from large population based surveys with record-based linkages to open interviews focusing on people's own descriptions of weight-related problems among obese and reduced-obese subjects. Results showed that gender-specific differences existed in weight-related problems. Excess body weight was associated with social and economic disadvantages, particularly among women. Weight loss maintenance required a constant battle against weight regain, and sustained weight loss was rare. In women, low initial well-being and health-compromising behaviour that improved after weight loss seemed to predict weight loss maintenance. In men, low level of stress, medical problems and health-related behaviour were associated with sustained weight loss. Permanent behavioural changes were required for sustainability of weight loss, and improvements in the quality of life were needed to compensate for sacrifices required by weight loss maintenance. Since adequate improvements in the well-being and quality of life were seldom experienced after weight loss, regain was understandable.}

In this short commentary, I contextualize this claim about context. The idea that context is crucial to meaning is shared across a wide range of disciplines, including the field of ?context-aware? recommender systems. These personalization systems attempt to take a user?s context into account in order to make better, more useful, more meaningful recommendations. How are we to square boyd and Crawford?s warning with the growth of big data applications that are centrally concerned with something they call ?context?? I suggest that the importance of context is uncontroversial; the controversy lies in determining what context is. Drawing on the work of cultural and linguistic anthropologists, I argue that context is constructed by the methods used to apprehend it. For the developers of ?context-aware? recommender systems, context is typically operationalized as a set of sensor readings associated with a user?s activity. For critics like boyd and Crawford, context is that unquantified remainder that haunts mathematical models, making numbers that appear to be identical actually different from each other. These understandings of context seem to be incompatible, and their variability points to the importance of identifying and studying ?context cultures??ways of producing context that vary in goals and techniques, but which agree that context is key to data?s significance. To do otherwise would be to take these contextualizations out of context.},

This paper presents textual network analysis-a network analysis procedure that transforms any given text into a visual map of words co-occurring together. It aims at scholars and students who are not familiar with network analysis, showing step-by-step how to use this approach and highlighting its advantages and applications. It demonstrates how to identify the main themes appearing in the text as well as to detect its biases and frames. Researchers can use this procedure as a grounded content analysis to formulate theories or as a basis to test existing hypotheses. The second part of the paper presents two studies that applied textual network analysis: (a) to identify the main themes raised by elite newspapers on the "fake news" discourse and (b) to map the topics related to China on Twitter. Both examples show how textual network analysis can be relevant for communication , international relations, and political science scholars as well as for practitioners, wishing to understand the prevailing discourses and tailor their messages more effectively.}

To address this, I analyze data from a social networking site that started charging its users for an app that populates their e-mail address books with updated contact information. I find that purchase rates of the app were higher for users with large, structurally diverse networks – which contain several distinct social groups. Moreover, personal ties (i.e., family members and friends) increased purchase rates more than professional ties. I attribute the first effect to the difficulty of obtaining information about a large, diverse social network, which the app reduces, and the second effect to the regularity with which people use information about their personal ties.}

To measure these trends, a long series of surveys with questions on subjective, personal happiness are analyzed. To test the adequacy of this measure, its association with more complex measures of well-being (e.g., the Bradburn Affect Balance scale and the Andrews and Withey life-feeling scale) was examined, and its testlretest stability determined. Both indicated that happiness might serve as a suitable indicator. Variations in question wording were examined in the happiness series. Differences were found that prevented all wordings being used in a uniform, single series, but the general trends were detectable by using the two main variations as parallel series. Possible seasonal and context effects were also found that further complicated the analysis of happiness. With the effects of variant wordings, seasons, and contexts taken into consideration, it appears that happiness rose from the late forties to the late fifties, then fell until the early seventies, and then, possibly after some rebound, remained stable from the early seventies to the present.}

Body weight, marital unhappiness, and marital problems were examined in a national telephone survey of 1,980 married adults. Few relationships between the 5 measures of weight and 2 measures of marital quality (unhappiness and problems) were significant. Obese men had more marital problems. Men who lost more weight reported marital problems less often. Obese women reported less marital unhappiness. Men and women who gained weight were happier with their marriages. These population-based findings differ from popular beliefs and clinical studies and may be interpreted using family functioning, social norms, and marital exchange models. © 1995, SAGE Periodicals Press.

In traditional societies a direct relationship between SES and fatness exists, while in modern societies there is an inverse association between SES and obesity for adult women but mixed patterns for other age/sex groups. A framework recognizing the difference between variables on the physical and social level of analysis needs to be used to examine the relationship between fatness (a physical variable) and SES (a social variable). Different mechanisms are involved in the causal pathways where SES influences obesity and obesity influences SES. SES influences obesity by education, income, and occupation causing variations in behaviors which change energy consumption, energy expenditure and metabolism. Obesity influences SES when the perception of obesity is interpreted through prejudiced beliefs, with subsequent stigmatization and discrimination limiting access to higher SES roles. © 1991, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

This study tested this assertion using a survey of eighty-seven officers in a midwestern municipal police agency, where female officers constituted over 17 percent of the total sworn patrol officers. The three dimensions of tokenism were examined quantitatively to ascertain differences between male and female officers. On two of the dimensions, there were no differences between male and female officers, but the third dimension showed that female officers still perceived their work place differently from male officers. Only partial support of Kanter's theory was found. It was evident that even in this department, however, females still felt like they stood out and were underestimated by their peers. The findings also suggested that tokenism is more complex than a "numbers game," and that quantitative examinations alone might not fully explain the myriad aspects of tokenism.}

One pathway concerns the calculation of the costs and benefits of participation; the other concerns collective identification with a social movement organization (SMO). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that calculation and collective identification processes made unique contributions to the prediction of willingness to participate. We also found that both processes exert additive effects rather than interactive effects on willingness to participate. Moreover, mediational analyses suggest that the effect of identification with the SMO on willingness to participate is mediated by an inner obligation to behave as a "good" group member. Whereas the calculation pathway is interpreted in terms of instrumental involvement motivated by specific extrinsic rewards, the identification pathway seems to represent intrinsic involvement based on the internalization of group-specific behavioral standards.}

Although associated consistently with psychological and economic outcomes, less is known about whether weight discrimination is associated with longitudinal changes in obesity. The objectives of this research are (1) to test whether weight discrimination is associated with risk of becoming obese (Body Mass Index≥30; BMI) by follow-up among those not obese at baseline, and (2) to test whether weight discrimination is associated with risk of remaining obese at follow-up among those already obese at baseline. Participants were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of community-dwelling US residents. A total of 6,157 participants (58.6\% female) completed the discrimination measure and had weight and height available from the 2006 and 2010 assessments. Participants who experienced weight discrimination were approximately 2.5 times more likely to become obese by follow-up (OR = 2.54, 95\% CI = 1.58-4.08) and participants who were obese at baseline were three times more likely to remain obese at follow up (OR = 3.20, 95\% CI = 2.06-4.97) than those who had not experienced such discrimination. These effects held when controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, education) and when baseline BMI was included as a covariate. These effects were also specific to weight discrimination; other forms of discrimination (e.g., sex, race) were unrelated to risk of obesity at follow-up. The present research demonstrates that, in addition to poorer mental health outcomes, weight discrimination has implications for obesity. Rather than motivating individuals to lose weight, weight discrimination increases risk for obesity. © 2013 Sutin, Terracciano.}

Methods To demonstrate the validity of this measure, we use ordinary least squares regression and an F-ratio test. Results We find that this measure, based on Google Insights data, behaves in a manner consistent with a valid measure of public attention. Moreover, this finding holds when the measure is included in a standard model used to explain U.S. Senate election outcomes. Conclusion The Google Insights measure of relative public attention shows the shifts in public attention as the campaign is waged and is consistent with how we would expect to see such a measure behave. This research opens numerous avenues for research in the campaigns and elections subfield.}

	abstract     = {The simultaneous increases in obesity in almost all countries seem to be driven mainly by changes in the global food system, which is producing more processed, affordable, and effectively marketed food than ever before. This passive overconsumption of energy leading to obesity is a predictable outcome of market economies predicated on consumption-based growth. The global food system drivers interact with local environmental factors to create a wide variation in obesity prevalence between populations. Within populations, the interactions between environmental and individual factors, including genetic makeup, explain variability in body size between individuals. However, even with this individual variation, the epidemic has predictable patterns in subpopulations. In low-income countries, obesity mostly affects middle-aged adults (especially women) from wealthy, urban environments; whereas in high-income countries it affects both sexes and all ages, but is disproportionately greater in disadvantaged groups. Unlike other major causes of preventable death and disability, such as tobacco use, injuries, and infectious diseases, there are no exemplar populations in which the obesity epidemic has been reversed by public health measures. This absence increases the urgency for evidence-creating policy action, with a priority on reduction of the supply-side drivers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

	abstract     = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many pathways connect stress and obesity, two highly prevalent problems facing society today. First, stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second, stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third, stress triggers physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reward processing in the brain, and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally, stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes, ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

	abstract     = {Recent scientific work has established both a theoretical basis and strong empirical evidence for a causal impact of social relationships on health. Prospective studies, which control for baseline health status, consistently show increased risk of death among persons with a low quantity, and sometimes low quality, of social relationships. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies ofhumans and animals also suggest that social isolation is a major risk factor for mortality from widely varying causes. The mechanisms through which social relationships affect health and the factors that promote or inhibit the development and maintenance of social relationships remain to be explored.. myfather told me ofa careflul observer, who certainly had heart-disease and died from it, and who positively stated that his pulse was habitually irregular to an extreme degree; yet to his great disappointment it invariably became regular as soon as myfather entered the room.-Charles Darwin (1) S CIENTISTS HAVE LONG NOTED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN social relationships and health. More socially isolated or less socially integrated individuals are less healthy, psychologically and physically, and more likely to die. The first major work of empirical sociology found that less socially integrated people were more likely to commit suicide than the most integrated (2). In subsequent epidemiologic research age-adjusted mortality rates from all causes of death are consistently higher among the unmarried than the married (3-5). Unmarried and more socially isolated people have also manifested higher rates of tuberculosis (6), accidents (7), and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (8, 9). And as the above quote from Darwin suggests, clinicians have also observed potentially health-enhancing qualities of social relationships and contacts. has, however, been less clear. Does a lack of social relationships cause people to become ill or die? Or are unhealthy people less likely to establish and maintain social relationships? Or is there some other factor, such as a misanthropic personality, which predisposes people both to have a lower quantity or quality of social relationships and to become ill or die? Such questions have been largely unanswerable before the last decade for two reasons. First, there was little theoretical basis for causal explanation. Durkheim (2) proposed a theory of how social relationships affected suicide, but this theory did not generalize to morbidity and mortality from other causes. Second, evidence of the association between social relationships and health, especially in general human populations, was almost entirely retrospective or cross-sectional before the late 1970s. Retrospective studies from death certificates or hospital records ascertained the nature of a person's social relationships after they had become ill or died, and cross-sectional surveys of general populations determined whether people who reported ill health also reported a lower quality or quantity of relationships. Such studies used statistical control of potential confounding variables to rule out third factors that might produce the association between social relationships and health, but could do this only partially. They could not determine whether poor social relationships preceded or followed ill health. 0.5 e 6-a 0}

To determine whether school or nonschool environments contribute more to childhood overweight, we compared children's gains in body mass index (BMI) when school is in session (during the kindergarten and first-grade school years) with their gains in BMI when school is out (during summer vacation). Methods. The BMIs of 5380 children in 310 schools were measured as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort. We used these measurements to estimate BMI gain rates during kindergarten, summer, and first grade. Results. Growth in BMI was typically faster and more variable during summer vacation than during the kindergarten and first-grade school years. The difference between school and summer gain rates was especially large for 3 at-risk subgroups: Black children, Hispanic children, and children who were already overweight at the beginning of kindergarten. Conclusions. Although a school's diet and exercise policies may be less than ideal, it appears that early school environments contribute less to overweight than do nonschool environments.}

There is disagreement about whether the obesity epidemic is entirely a recent phenomenon or a continuation of longstanding trends. Design and Methods The BMIs of 1,116 children who participated in the Fels Longitudinal Study near Dayton, Ohio were analyzed. Children were born between 1930 and 1993 and measured between 3 and 18 years of age. Results Between the birth cohorts of 1930 and 1993, the prevalence of obesity rose from 0 to 14\% among boys and from 2 to 12\% among girls. The prevalence of overweight rose from 10 to 28\% among boys and from 9 to 21\% among girls. The mean BMI Z score rose from +0.25 to +0.72 among boys and from -0.11 to +0.26 among girls. Among boys, all these increases began after birth year 1970. Among girls, obesity began to rise after birth year 1980, but overweight and BMI Z-scores were already rising as early as the 1930s and 1940s. Conclusions Most of the results suggest that the child obesity epidemic was recent and sudden. The recency of the epidemic offers some hope that it may be reversed.

	abstract     = {Discrimination can damage health by limiting an occupation to persons who are physically unsuited to it. In thoroughbred racing, male jockeys damage their health to reach racing weights, while women who could reach those weights more easily are excluded. The authors estimate the number of U.S. men and women who are light enough to work as jockeys and contrast them with the number of male and female jockeys. The authors contrast the distribution of body mass index in the general population and among top jockeys. Male jockeys outnumber female jockeys by 7 to 1, and by 50 to 1 in top races, and these numbers have not declined since the 1990s. Yet among adults who are light enough to work as jockeys, women outnumber men by at least 7 to 1, and women are half as likely to be underweight. Jockeys’ health and performance might improve if barriers to women were lowered.}

	abstract     = {Objective: To assess the relative importance of school and nonschool risk factors, this study estimated whether overweight and obesity prevalence grows faster during the school year or during summer vacation. Methods: In the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–11, a nationally representative complex random sample of 18,170 U.S. children was followed from the fall of kindergarten in 2010 through the spring of second grade in 2013. Children's weight and heights were measured in schools each fall and spring. A multilevel growth model was used to estimate growth in mean BMI, overweight prevalence, and obesity prevalence during each summer and each school year. Results: From the fall of kindergarten to the spring of second grade, the prevalence of obesity increased from 8.9\% to 11.5\%, and the prevalence of overweight increased from 23.3\% to 28.7\%. All of the increase in prevalence occurred during the two summer vacations; no increase occurred during any of the three school years. Conclusions: The risk of obesity is higher when children are out of school than when they are in school.}

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men (1966-1990), we evaluate major social pathways by which early life conditions differentiate the mortality experiences of blacks and whites. Our findings indicate that early life socioeconomic conditions, particularly parental occupation and family structure, explain part of the race gap in mortality. Black men's higher rates of death are associated with lower socioeconomic standing in early life and living in homes lacking both biological parents. However, these effects operate indirectly through adult socioeconomic achievement processes, as education, family income, wealth, and occupational complexity statistically account for the race gap in men's mortality. Our findings suggest that policy interventions to eliminate race disparities in mortality and health should address both childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions.}

	abstract     = {Most major population surveys used by social scientists are based on complex sampling designs where sampling units have different probabilities of being selected. Although sampling weights must generally be used to derive unbiased estimates of univariate population characteristics, the decision about their use in regression analysis is more complicated. Where sampling weights are solely a function of independent variables included in the model, unweighted OLS estimates are preferred because they are unbiased, consistent, and have smaller standard errors than weighted OLS estimates. Where sampling weights are a function of the dependent variable (and thus of the error term), we recommend first attempting to respecify the model so that they are solely a function of the independent variables. If this can be accomplished, then unweighted OLS is again preferred. If the model cannot be respecified, then estimation of the model using sampling weights may be appropriate. In this case, however, the formula used by most computer programs for calculating standard errors will be incorrect. We recommend using the White heteroskedastic consistent estimator for the standard errors. © 1994, SAGE PERIODICALS PRESS. All rights reserved.}

This sex difference was explained in terms of men's and women's social roles: The female (vs. male) gender role specifies greater emotional responsiveness. Furthermore, past role-related experiences provide women with appropriate skills and attitudes. Women's (vs. men's) greater well-being was also found to hold for married but not unmarried Ss: For both sexes the married state (vs. unmarried) was associated with favorable well-being, but the favorable outcomes proved stronger for women than men. Given that most Ss were married, the overall sex difference in well-being can be attributed to Ss' marital status. These findings were discussed in the context of prior research on sex differences in negative well-being.}

	abstract     = {A generative turn in scholarship examines the institutional and political dimensions of Islamophobia, conceptualizing Muslim representations as a mechanism of ethnoracial formation in which the media is one such site of racialization. Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.}

Google Trends results per region in Italy or state in the~US were~compared to~COVID-19 incidence~in the corresponding geographical areas.~The~COVID-19 incidence did not correlate with searches for non-symptoms, but~in~some weeks had high correlation with taste and smell loss searches, which also correlated with each other. Correlation of the sensory symptoms with new COVID-19 cases for each country as a whole was high at some~time points, but decreased (Italy) or dramatically fluctuated over time (US).~Smell loss searches correlated with~the incidence of~media reports in the US. Our results show that popularity of~symptom~searches is not~reliable~for pandemic monitoring.

One hypothesis discussed in the press and by some social scientists is that this increase was tied to political mobilization against police violence: As the Black Lives Matter movement gained support following protests in Ferguson, Missouri, perhaps police officers, worried about the new public mood, scaled back their law enforcement efforts, with crime as a consequence. In this article, we examine the association between public concern over police violence and crime rates using Google search measures to estimate the former. Analyzing data on 43 large U.S. cities, we find that violent crime was higher and rose more in cities where concern about police violence was greatest. We also find that measures of social inequality predict crime rates. We conclude by discussing the implications for future research on the “Ferguson effect” and beyond.},

A key problem always has been the lack of clear theoretical concepts about the interpretation of interview and survey question and answer frames. We lack a theory of comprehension and communication that can provide a foundation for the way that question-answer systems function, and the way respondents understand them. The paper briefly describes the possible relevance of linguistic and cognitive processes for improving our understanding of interviews and surveys. The theoretical foundations of interviews and surveys also must address the way that artificial circumstances become necessary to guarantee adequate study designs. These artificial circumstances often violate ecological validity, or the way interviews and survey questions are constructed, understood, and answered, as contrasted with the way that field notes and tape-recordings of natural settings are used to address the same or comparable substantive and theoretical issues.},

These data sets are often ?found data? arising from purely observational sources rather than data derived under strict rules of a statistically designed experiment. However, since these large data sets easily meet the sample size requirements of most statistical procedures, they give analysts a false sense of security as they proceed to focus on employing traditional statistical methods. We explain how most analyses performed on Big Data today lead to ?precisely inaccurate? results that hide biases in the data but are easily overlooked due to the enhanced significance of the results created by the data size. Before any analyses are performed on large data sets, we recommend employing a simple data segmentation technique to control for some major components of observational data biases. These segments will help to improve the accuracy of the results.},
